## Problem Statement
#### Analysis of various shortest path algorithms to find shortest path in 2-D plane with obstacles from source to destination. This is very useful algorithm to find the safest location for the people(eg. villagers) around you while shooting a target on a war. There are many deterministic as well as heuristic algorithms which can be used to find the shortest reach to the destination.
